# FEND-HomeTownApp
Small project #2 focusing on responsive web design.

--Part 1--
1) Add a <meta> viewport to the page with initial scale set.
2) Adjust CSS and markup so that everything displays in a single column. Use relative widths so that things stretch to fit across any viewport width.
3) Make sure your touch targets are easy to hit.
4) Test your site across different viewports. Try it on different phones, tablets, and desktops!


--Part 2--
1) Pick a set of breakpoints and use one of the patterns that you've learned to style the page so it works across different devices.
2) Test on multiple phones, tablets, and browser window sizes and adjust your breakpoints until you're happy.
